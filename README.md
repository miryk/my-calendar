# My Calendar

## Description
- An calendar that shows each month of a year. Now, by default 2022. 
- It shows a option to select the month and renders with a side panel that will show the events of the month (for now).
- When clicked in a date shows a dialog to input a new event with emoji options and a text input to write the description. 
- When the data is submited, will show the emoji in the calendar, the date and description in the side bar. 
- When the cursor hovers over the emoji in the calendar shows more of the details. 
- The app currently doesn't save any data, is mainly frontend. If the page is refreshed or month is switched all will be reset.

## How to Run Locally
Download all the files in a folder. Doble clik or drag to a browser window the `index.html` file.

## Additional notes
Theres a bug that accumulates the dates of the events. The first events shows correctly but the second shows two dates ans successively.   
Future changes will make the side bar contain all saved events in order with month separators.  
Date and events will be saved so when the month is loaded and theres already events it will show.  
In the long run this is thought to be a feature in a Bullet journal type of organizational app.
